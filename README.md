Holy Crop
Minnehack 2019

The goal of this project is to create a consistent income for farmers by interfacing them with investors who are willing to provide
farmers with startup capital in exchange for a percentage of their profits. This can help farmers maintain a stable annual income
regardless of unforeseen weather conditions or other circumstances that inhibit production. The interface is a website on which both
farmers and investors can make and view proposals which describe what crops they can grow or would invest in, the price at which they
would like to sell or buy, and a return percentage for the investors.

The website can be accessed at holycrop-5ae98.firebaseapp.com.
